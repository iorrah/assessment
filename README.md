This methodology measures 6 dimensions to understand an individual’s culture norms:

- Adaptability: Readily takes advantage of new opportunities
- Results-orientation: Gets things done
- Collaboration: Is a great team player
- Attention to detail: Values precision and accuracy
- Principles: Holds high ethical standards
- Customer-orientation: Always keeps the customer in mind
